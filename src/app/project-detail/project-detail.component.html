				<h3>The Challenge</h3>
				<!-- <h4>How can kids relax if they don't know how this feels?</h4> -->
				<p>Children in North America are more likely to suffer from anxiety and attentional challenges than any other mental health issues. Mind-Full was developed to help these children learn to self-regulate. Using commercial EEG-headset technolgoy, Mind-Full provides real-time feedback on children's stress and attention levels and rewards them through game animations for achieving customizable thresholds. Results from our research studies suggest kids can take these skills and apply them outside of context of using the app.</p>
				<p>I work closely on many aspects of this prject. When I joined, the initial application was already built, and a study had been completed in Nepal. I contributed to the design and development of 2 new games, I have worked on two research studies, analyzed statistical results, co-authored papers, and presented the work at international conferences. My master's work also center's on Mind-Full</p>

		<h3>The Process</h3>
		<h4>New context, new games</h4>
		<p>I helped with developing new games</p>

 -->
		<h4>Running Studies</h4>
		<p>I have run a controlled waitlist study using the system with 25 adults. I assisted with running a study with 28 children in the Burnaby School District. I am in the process of running a co-design study with children ages 8-9 at a school in Vancouver. </p>

		<h3>Nerofeedback FTW</h3>
		<h4>Building NEw</h4>
		<img src="img/stanford.jpg">
		<p>My research will contribute knowledge about the impact of audio feedback on children's (relaxed vs. anxious)brain states, the efficacy of audio in NF apps, and produce an enhanced NF system for use in future studies.Our research using Mind-Full is ongoing.  I hope to complete my co-design data collection by Feburary 2017. </p>
		<p>I now feel comfortable working with neural data and have created more complex neurofeedback games using Open BCI hardware during the Brain Hack DC 2017</p>
