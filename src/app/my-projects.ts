  challenge: 'Children in North America are more likely to suffer from anxiety and attentional challenges than any other mental health issue. These children often have challenges staying calm and attentive in classroom environments. But how can they calm down and focus, if they don’t know how this feels?'+'<br>'+' We developed Mind-Full to help kids practice controlling their mental state, and better understand what it feels like to be in a calm, attentive state of mind. This system uses a consumer EEG-headset to provide real-time feedback on children’s stress and attention levels, rewarding them for achieving goals. I joined the team in 2016, we had an existing prototype that we wanted to refine and redesign for an upcoming study with a local school district. In my work on this project I contributed to the development of new games, helped run multiple studies, analyzed results, and co-authored several papers. My master’s research also stems from this work. We created this video about Mind-Full to help people better understand the project (I co-wrote the script and recorded the voiceover):',
